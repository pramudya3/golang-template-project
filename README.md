## Golang Template Project

This repository provides a base project template for building Go applications using Uber FX for dependency injection and Gin Gonic for server handling.

### Getting Started

This template offers a quick starting point for your Go project with essential dependencies already set up.

**Prerequisites:**

* Golang (version 1.18 or higher) installed on your system. You can download it from the official website [https://go.dev/doc/install](https://go.dev/doc/install).

**Using the Template:**

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal window and navigate to the project directory.
3. Rename the project directory to your desired project name.
4. Initialize your project's module by running:

```bash
go mod init "your-project-name"
```

   Replace `your-project-name` with your actual project name.

5. Tidy up the project dependencies by running:

```bash
go mod tidy
```

This will ensure your project uses the latest compatible versions of dependencies.

### Project Structure

The project follows a basic structure with the following directories:

* **cmd:** This directory will house the main application entry point (`main.go`).
* **internal:** This directory contains your application's core logic, separated into well-defined packages.
* **pkg:** This directory (optional) can hold reusable Go packages that might be shared across different projects.

### Dependencies

* **Uber FX:** This project uses Uber FX for dependency injection. Refer to the Uber FX documentation [https://github.com/uber-go/fx](https://github.com/uber-go/fx) for detailed information.
* **Gin Gonic:** This project uses Gin Gonic as the web server framework. Refer to the Gin Gonic documentation [https://gin-gonic.com/](https://gin-gonic.com/) for detailed information.

### Running the Project

(Modify these instructions based on your specific implementation)

1. Implement your application logic within the `internal` directory.
2. Configure your server routes and dependencies using Uber FX in a dedicated file (e.g., `internal/server/server.go`).
3. Update the `main.go` file to reference your server configuration and start the application using Uber FX.
4. Run the application using:

```bash
go run main.go
```

### Next Steps

This template provides a foundational structure to build your Go application with dependency injection and server handling. Customize the `internal` directory with your specific application logic and implement functionalities as needed. Refer to the documentation of Uber FX and Gin Gonic for further insights on building robust Go applications.
